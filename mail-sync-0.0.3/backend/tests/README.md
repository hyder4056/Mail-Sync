# FastAPI Testing Standards and Best Practices

When building an API with FastAPI, testing is a crucial part of the development process to ensure the API is functioning correctly and can handle various scenarios. Here are some testing standards and best practices to follow:

## Testing Framework

FastAPI recommends using pytest as the testing framework. Pytest provides several features that make testing easier, such as fixtures, parameterized testing, and extensive reporting. Use [TestClient](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/#using-testclient) for testing routes (both async and sync).

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow when writing tests:

- **Write independent tests:** Each test should be independent of other tests to ensure consistent results.
- **Use fixtures:** Fixtures can help to set up common test data and make tests more readable. Use [conftest.py](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/reference/fixtures.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files) for sharing fixture across files.
- **Use parameterized testing:** Parameterized testing can help to test multiple scenarios with minimal code.
- **Use descriptive test names:** Descriptive test names can help to quickly identify the purpose of a test and make debugging easier.
- **Test edge cases:** Testing edge cases can help to ensure the API can handle unexpected scenarios.
- **Test error handling:** Testing error handling can help to ensure the API returns meaningful error messages.
- **Use mocking:** Mocking can help to isolate parts of the codebase and make testing more efficient.
- **Use code coverage tools:** Code coverage tools can help to identify untested parts of the codebase.
- **Run tests automatically:** Running tests automatically can help to catch errors early and ensure consistent testing.

By following these standards and best practices, you can ensure your FastAPI API is reliable and functioning correctly in various scenarios.

## Mocking requests

Use [pytest-httpx](https://github.com/Colin-b/pytest_httpx) for mocking httpx module requests.
